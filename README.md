- 🔐 An incoming master student at UC Berkeley, currently deferred at home, trying to get things right to become a software engineer.
- 🤨 Why? less interested in **EE** major things.

- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning open-source CS courses. The ones I have finished learning (lectures & projects & labs) include: 
  - **Berkeley CS 61A (Fall 2020)** ✔️ **Videos** ✔️ **Discs** ✔️ **Labs** ✔️ **Hws** ✔️ **Projs**
  - **Stanford CS 106X  (Winter 2017 & Autumn 2018)** ✔️ **Videos (Win17)** ✔️ **Discs (Fa18)** ✔️ **Assignments (Win17 & Fa18)**
  - **UIUC CS 225 (Fall 2020)** ✔️ **Videos**
  - **Stanford CS 106L (Autumn 2019)** ✔️ **Videos** ✔️ **Discs** ✔️ **Assignments (with the 2020 Spring final project version)**
  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Berkeley CS 61C (Fall 2021)**----Week **10**, and prepare to learn **Berkeley CS 170 (Fall 2021)** after that to prepare for some interview.
- 🛠️ **CMU 15445 (Fall 2021)** after that? Well, I don't know if I have enough time. I need sometime to go for the **Leetcode**.

- The *self-learning notes* are all posted on my [Blog](https://shaopu.tech/) (in Chinese). All of the projects/assignments/labs/hws are now kept as Github private repositories.
