- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently self-learning open-source CS courses. The ones I have finished learning (lectures & projects & labs) include: 
  - **Berkeley CS 61A (Fall 2020)**
  - **Stanford CS 106X  (Winter 2017 & Autumn 2018) / UIUC CS 225 (Fall 2020, only videos)**
  - **Stanford CS 106L (Autumn 2019)**
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Berkeley CS 61C (Fall 2021)**, and might choose to learn **Berkeley CS 170 (Fall 2021)** after that to prepare for some interview.

  The *self-learning notes* are all posted on my [Blog](shaopu.tech) (in Chinese). The projects are now kept as Github private repositories.
